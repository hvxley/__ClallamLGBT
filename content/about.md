## About the Author
Cloud Huxley was born in Port Angeles and graduated from Sequim High School in 2003.
Cloud uses "she/they" pronouns in all aspects of her life. She works with the public
during the day and writes code at night. Cloud is a proud Queer Anarchist who believes
that Queer Liberation is just as much an inalienable right as any, and will not
ask permission to exist.

Cloud created [Clallam|LGBT](https://clallam.lgbt/) for the dissemination of Queer
resources. The information within these pages is meant to be spread, and it was
built from the ground up to accomplish that task.

## Technology Stack
[Clallam|LGBT](https://clallam.lgbt/) is built on the shoulders of giants.
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static-site generator manages our online resources
into a functional site.
* The [Clarity Theme](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity) provides the
"look & feel".
* Hosting is provided by [Neocities](https://neocities.org/).
* The Domain Name was provided by [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/).
* Project source code is available at [Github](https://github.com/hvxley/ClallamLGBT/).

My design is simple, transparent, and the code is available for study.
