**Welcome**
First pages are always interesting because they are quickly out-dated. I am very
hopeful about the rapid growth of this site once the foundation is properly complete,
and I wish to address the future of [Clallam|LGBT](https://clallam.lgbt/):
1. Template modifications are ongoing for the foreseeable future.
2. The glossary will be designed to expand outwards with no expectation of finite boundaries
3. Events will be updated as we get closer to Pride Seasonâ„¢.
4. I'm always looking for additional content contributors, whether graphics, coders, or writers!
